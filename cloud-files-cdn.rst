 Rackspace Cloud Files CDN using Heat
=====================================

Brief summary
=============

A CDN-enabled container is a public container that is served by the Akamai content delivery network. The files in a CDN-enabled container are publicly accessible and do not require an authentication token for read access. However, uploading content into a CDN-enabled container is a secure operation and does require a valid authentication token. (Private containers are not CDN-enabled and the files in a private container are not publicly accessible.)
